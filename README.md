# Mapping_Earthquakes
## Purpose
Having already mapped out earhtquakes over the past seven days, based off of US Geological Survey data, further analysis to view earthquakes by magnitude and tectonic plate location was requested to bring further detail to the analysis.

To include this analysis in our website that preciously just recorded earthquake location, a layer to include tectonic plates was added, as well as drilling into earthquakes that were 4.5 magnitude or higher only. This provided a greater focus regarding analysis on higher magnitude earthquakes, with a focus on potential influence by placement on a tectonic plate.
